# GhostAdvancers
Useful mods (NO CHEATS) for Ghost Wachters

## Features

### Implemented
 * Quick Play (join new lobbies automatically!)
 * Speed- and grabbing hack detection

### Planned
 * Noclip detection
 * "Photo" mode (basically free cam, but only around the player and without noclip)
 * Positional audio for other players (hear your teammates direction!)

## Installation
1. Install MelonLoader into the game ([tutorial](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation))
2. Start the game once
3. Copy the [latest version](https://github.com/niansa/GhostAdvancers/releases) into the `Mods` folder

## Contribution
If you want to participiate in the development, feel free to create pull requests or [but reports](https://github.com/niansa/GhostAdvancers/issues)!

*Tip:* Using Unity Explorer really helps in development since it allows inspecting the state of the game at any point of time and to run custom C# code on the go.
